# About the project

This is a defi protocole composed of two tokens :
- Learnable which is the token needed in staking.
- LearnableReward which is the token gained as a reward.

The LearnableStaking smart contact allows the investor to :
- Stake a given amount of token.
- Withdraw a staked amount of token.
- Check the amount of reward collected.
- Withdraw an amount of the reward collected.

The reward are calculated on a epoch basis according to the APY and without any compounding.

A front-end web client is to be developped soon.
